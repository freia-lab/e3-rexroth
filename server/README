Linux packages:

ealsdk-2.2.0-0.noarch.rpm.zip:
https://www.boschrexroth.com/sv/se/media-details/0e437020-893e-4ad8-988b-4c5c4f01c71a

ealsdk-2.2.0-0.deb.zip:
https://www.boschrexroth.com/sv/se/media-details/b7a0f168-f85d-4890-a9fb-0569a9bd26b7

The Makefile assumes that the packages are installed in /usr/local

On Centos 7 one has to set environment variable EAL_SDK_02. It should point to the parent 
directory of eal4Java.
On Ubuntu 20.04.3 it was not needed as long one used the same localtion of the java libraries
during the linking.
