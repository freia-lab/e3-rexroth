StreamDevServer uses the EAL library from Bosch Rexroth. It can be found here:

Linux packages:

ealsdk-2.2.0-0.noarch.rpm.zip:

The Makefile assumes that the packages are installed in /usr/local

On Centos 7 one has to set environment variable EAL_SDK_02. It should point to the parent 
directory of eal4Java.
On Ubuntu 20.04.3 it was not needed as long one used the same localtion of the java libraries
during the linking.

To compile the server run
make server
in the top directory

To run the server run the commands: (example when EAL for Java is in /opt/eal4Java)
export=EAL_SDK_02=/opt
make run-server ARGS="-drive_ip 192.168.10.46 -port 2160 -max_conn 2 -bind_addr 0.0.0.0"

where; 
      -drive_ip defins the IP address of the motor controller (mandatory)
      -port port number of the server (default 2195)
      -bind_addr - default localhost
      -max_conn - maximum simultaneous connections (default 1, >1 is usefull when debugging using netcat)
