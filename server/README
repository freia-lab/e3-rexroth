StreamDevServer uses the EAL library from Bosch Rexroth. It can be found here:

The Makefile assumes that the packages are installed in /usr/local

On Centos 7 one has to set environment variable EAL_SDK_02. It should point to the parent 
directory of eal4Java in our case /usr/local/eal_sdk/02VRS

On Ubuntu 20.04.3 it was not needed for version 2.400 as long one used the same location
of the java libraries during the linking. Server compiled with version Version 2500
didn't work unles EAL_SDK_02 was not set correctly.

To compile the server run
make server
in the top directory

To run the server run the commands: (example when EAL_SDK is in /usr/local):

export=EAL_SDK_02=/usr/local/eal_sdk/02VRS
make server-run ARGS="-drive_ip 192.168.10.46 -port 2160 -max_conn 2 -bind_addr 0.0.0.0"

where; 
      -drive_ip defins the IP address of the motor controller (mandatory)
      -port port number of the server (default 2195)
      -bind_addr - default localhost
      -max_conn - maximum simultaneous connections (default 1, >1 is usefull when debugging using netcat)

To install server in /opt/rexroth-server run:

make server-install.

To start the server at the boot time an example rexroth_server.service in this directory
can be copied to /etc/systemd/system and enabled using the command:

sudo systemctl enable rexroth-server
